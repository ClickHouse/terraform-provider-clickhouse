  Use the clickhouse_service_private_endpoints_attachment resource to attach a ClickHouse service to a Private Endpoint.
  Important: Please note that if you want to attach the same ClickHouse service to multiple Private Endpoints you have to specify all the Private Endpoint IDs in a single clickhouse_service_private_endpoints_attachment resource.
  Having multiple clickhouse_service_private_endpoints_attachment resources for the same service is unsupported and the outcome is unpredictable.
  See private_endpoint_registration https://registry.terraform.io/providers/ClickHouse/clickhouse/latest/docs/resources/private_endpoint_registration for how to create a private endpoint.
