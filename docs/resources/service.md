## Import

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import services using their `id`. For example:

```terraform
import {
  to = clickhouse_service.this
  id = "01a2b34c-d56e-7f8a-bc9d-0efabc12defa"
}
```

Using `terraform import`, import services using their `id`. For example:

```console
% terraform import clickhouse_service.this 01a2b34c-d56e-7f8a-bc9d-0efabc12defa
```
