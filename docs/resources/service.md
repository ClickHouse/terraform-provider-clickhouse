# clickhouse_service (Resource)

You can use the *clickhouse_service* resource to deploy ClickHouse cloud instances on supported cloud providers.

Known limitations:

- If you create a service with `warehouse_id` set and then remove `warehouse_id` attribute completely, the provider won't detect the change. If you want to make a secondary service become primary, remove the `warehouse_id` and taint it before applying.
- If you create a service with `readonly` flag set to true and then remove `readonly` flag completely, the provider won't detect the change. If you want to make a secondary service read write, explicitly set the `readonly` flag to false.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "clickhouse_service" "service" {
  name           = "My Service"
  cloud_provider = "aws"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  idle_scaling   = true

  ip_access = [
    {
      source      = "192.168.2.63"
      description = "Test IP"
    }
  ]

  min_total_memory_gb  = 24
  max_total_memory_gb  = 360
  idle_timeout_minutes = 5

  password_hash  = "n4bQgYhMfWWaL+qgxVrQFaO/TxsrC4Is0V1sFbDwCgg=" # base64 encoded sha256 hash of "test"
}
```

- `region` (String) Region within the cloud provider in which the service is deployed in.

### Optional

- `backup_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration of service backup settings. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--backup_configuration))

- `max_total_memory_gb` (Number, Deprecated) Maximum total memory of all workers during auto-scaling in GiB.
- `min_replica_memory_gb` (Number) Minimum memory of a single replica during auto-scaling in GiB.
- `min_total_memory_gb` (Number, Deprecated) Minimum total memory of all workers during auto-scaling in GiB.
- `num_replicas` (Number) Number of replicas for the service.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the default user. One of either `password` or `password_hash` must be specified.
- `password_hash` (String, Sensitive) SHA256 hash of password for the default user. One of either `password` or `password_hash` must be specified.
- `query_api_endpoints` (Attributes) Configuration of the query API endpoints feature. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--query_api_endpoints))
- `readonly` (Boolean) Indicates if this service should be read only. Only allowed for secondary services, those which share data with another service (i.e. when `warehouse_id` field is set).
- `release_channel` (String) Release channel to use for this service. Can be 'default', 'fast' or 'slow'.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags associated with the service as key-value pairs.
- `tier` (String) Tier of the service: 'development', 'production'. Required for organizations using the Legacy ClickHouse Cloud Tiers, must be omitted for organizations using the new ClickHouse Cloud Tiers.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
# Services can be imported by specifying the UUID.
terraform import clickhouse_service.example xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```
