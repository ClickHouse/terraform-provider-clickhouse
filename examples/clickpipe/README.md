# Experimental `clickhouse_clickpipe` resource usage examples

This directory contains a set of example configurations for deploying a ClickHouse ClickPipe with different input sources.

Note: These examples are not provisioning ClickHouse service for you. You need to have a ClickHouse service running before deploying a ClickPipe.
Except a `service_and_clickpipe` example, which provisions a ClickHouse service and a ClickPipe in one go.
